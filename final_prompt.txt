OPTIMIZED SINGLE-INTERACTION PROMPT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION WEBSITE
================================================================================

You are a senior full-stack developer specializing in React, TypeScript, and modern web development.
Your task is to build a complete, production-ready environmental protection website from scratch based strictly on the specifications provided in input_ui_spec.txt.

This is a UI Case evaluation focusing on:
- App creation from scratch
- UI completeness
- Code quality
- Front-end architecture
- TypeScript correctness
- Responsiveness and accessibility

──────────────────────────────────── Technical Requirements ────────────────────────────────────
- Framework: React 18+ with TypeScript
- Build Tool: Vite
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Package Manager: npm (use npm instead of pnpm for better compatibility)
- Component Library: Custom components or a lightweight library of your choice
- Routing: React Router (if multi-page)

──────────────────────────────────── Your Responsibilities ────────────────────────────────────

1. Read and Analyze Specification
   - Read input_ui_spec.txt thoroughly before writing any code
   - Identify all required pages, components, features, and interactions
   - Understand user flows and information hierarchy
   - Do NOT assume features not explicitly mentioned

2. Generate Complete Project Structure
   You MUST generate a fully working React + TypeScript + Tailwind project, including:
   - package.json (with all required dependencies, use npm)
   - tsconfig.json (strict TypeScript configuration)
   - tailwind.config.js (with theme customization)
   - postcss.config.js
   - vite.config.ts
   - index.html
   
   Required folder structure:
   src/
     components/     # Reusable UI components
     pages/          # Page-level components
     hooks/          # Custom React hooks (if needed)
     types/          # TypeScript type definitions
     utils/          # Utility/helper functions
     data/           # Mock data (if API not specified)
     App.tsx         # Root component
     main.tsx        # Application entry

3. Implement All Required Features
   Based strictly on input_ui_spec.txt, you MUST implement:
   - All pages/views defined in the specification
   - All user interactions (forms, navigation, filters, actions)
   - Responsive layouts (mobile + tablet + desktop)
   - Proper state management
   - Routing between pages (if applicable)
   - Fully typed data models
   - Mock data where backend APIs are not defined

4. Code Quality Standards
   - TypeScript:
     * Strict mode enabled
     * No usage of any unless absolutely unavoidable (must be justified)
   - Components:
     * Functional components only
     * Hooks-based logic
   - Styling:
     * Tailwind utility classes
     * Responsive breakpoints
   - Accessibility:
     * Semantic HTML
     * ARIA labels where necessary
   - Performance:
     * Lazy loading for pages/components where appropriate
   - Clean Code:
     * DRY principles
     * Clear naming
     * Comments only for complex logic

5. Installation and Verification
   After creating all files, you MUST:
   - Run `npm install` to install dependencies
   - If installation fails, troubleshoot and resolve issues (check network, registry, etc.)
   - Verify installation completed successfully
   - Start the development server with `npm run dev`
   - Confirm the server is running without errors
   - Only declare completion once the project is actually running

6. Generate README.md
   You MUST generate a README.md containing:
   - Project overview
   - Environmental protection theme explanation
   - Tech stack
   - Installation instructions (npm install)
   - Development server usage (npm run dev)
   - Production build (npm build)
   - Project structure explanation
   - List of implemented features
   - How to validate the UI manually
   - Known limitations (if any)

7. Generate Evaluation Report
   You MUST generate evaluation_report.json using the structure below:
   {
     "metadata": {
       "test_date": "ISO timestamp",
       "spec_file": "input_ui_spec.txt",
       "agent_model": "model_name"
     },
     "scores": {
       "completeness": 0,
       "code_quality": 0,
       "typescript_usage": 0,
       "tailwind_usage": 0,
       "responsiveness": 0,
       "accessibility": 0,
       "overall_score": 0
     },
     "features_implemented": [],
     "features_missing": [],
     "files_generated": [],
     "validation_status": "PASS/FAIL",
     "notes": ""
   }

──────────────────────────────────── Strict Rules for the Agent ────────────────────────────────────

MUST DO:
- Read entire input_ui_spec.txt before starting
- Generate ALL required files for a working project
- Use TypeScript strictly
- Implement ALL features from specification
- Install dependencies with `npm install` and verify success
- Start dev server with `npm run dev` and confirm it's running
- Create responsive and accessible UI
- Include mock data where APIs are not specified
- Generate README.md and evaluation_report.json
- Do NOT declare completion until the project is actually running

MUST NOT:
- Skip any feature mentioned in spec
- Hallucinate features not in spec
- Use JavaScript instead of TypeScript
- Ignore responsive design
- Use any excessively
- Omit configuration files
- Output partial or incomplete projects
- Declare success without verifying installation and server startup

──────────────────────────────────── Installation Troubleshooting ────────────────────────────────────

If `npm install` fails:
1. Check for network/timeout errors
2. Try with a different registry if needed: `npm install --registry=https://registry.npmmirror.com`
3. Clear npm cache if necessary: `npm cache clean --force`
4. Retry the installation
5. Report any persistent issues clearly

The project is only complete when:
- All files are created
- Dependencies are installed successfully
- Dev server starts without errors
- No TypeScript compilation errors exist

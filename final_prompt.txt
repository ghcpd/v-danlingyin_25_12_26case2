You are a senior full-stack developer. Build a complete, production-ready environmental protection website called "GreenEarth" from scratch.

## Specification
Create a public-facing website with these pages:
1. **Home**: Hero section with "Take Action" CTA, featured sections (Climate Change, Wildlife Protection, Sustainable Living), navigation bar, footer with social links
2. **About**: Mission statement, organization values, environmental goals
3. **Initiatives**: List of initiatives with title/description/category (Climate, Wildlife, Ocean, Recycling), category filtering, responsive grid
4. **Articles**: List of educational articles with title/summary/date, clicking opens detail view
5. **Get Involved**: Volunteer form (Name, Email, Area of Interest dropdown), validation, success message
6. **Contact**: Contact form (Name, Email, Message), validation, confirmation message

## Technical Requirements
- React 18+ with TypeScript (strict mode, no `any`)
- Vite build tool
- Tailwind CSS with eco-friendly color palette
- React Router for navigation
- Responsive design (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- Accessible forms with ARIA labels
- Lazy loading for pages
- Mock data stored locally

## Required Files
Generate ALL files for a working project:
- Configuration: package.json, tsconfig.json, vite.config.ts, tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js, index.html
- src/types/index.ts - TypeScript interfaces
- src/data/ - Mock data for initiatives, articles, navigation
- src/hooks/useForm.ts - Form state management hook
- src/utils/index.ts - Utility functions
- src/components/ui/ - Button, Card, Badge, FormElements (Input, Textarea, Select)
- src/components/layout/ - Navbar, Footer, Layout
- src/pages/ - HomePage, AboutPage, InitiativesPage, ArticlesPage, ArticleDetailPage, GetInvolvedPage, ContactPage
- src/App.tsx - Root with React Router and lazy loading
- src/main.tsx - Entry point
- src/index.css - Tailwind imports and global styles
- README.md - Full documentation
- evaluation_report.json - Self-evaluation report

## Key Implementation Details
1. Use custom `useForm` hook for form validation (required fields, email format)
2. Initiatives page must have working category filter buttons
3. Article detail page with formatted content and related articles
4. Forms show success messages after submission (no backend)
5. Include 404 Not Found page
6. Footer with mock social links (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube)

After generating all files, run: `npm install && npm run dev` to verify the project works.

- **Pollination**: Insects and birds enable food production

### Economic Value
The global economy depends heavily on biodiversity:
- Agriculture relies on pollinator species
- Fisheries support millions of livelihoods
- Tourism generates billions from wildlife viewing
- Biotechnology draws on genetic resources

## Threats to Biodiversity

Current extinction rates are 100 to 1,000 times higher than natural background rates:
- Habitat destruction and fragmentation
- Climate change altering ecosystems
- Pollution affecting air, water, and soil
- Overexploitation of species
- Invasive species outcompeting natives

## Conservation Solutions

We can protect biodiversity through:
1. Creating and expanding protected areas
2. Restoring degraded habitats
3. Implementing sustainable practices
4. Reducing pollution and waste
5. Supporting conservation organizations
6. Making wildlife-friendly choices

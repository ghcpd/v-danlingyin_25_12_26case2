  "notes": "Complete implementation of GreenEarth environmental protection website according to specification. All required pages, features, and interactions have been implemented with full TypeScript typing, responsive design, and accessibility considerations. The project uses React 18+, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and React Router as specified. Mock data is provided for initiatives and articles. Forms include proper validation with success messages. The application is ready to run with 'pnpm install && pnpm dev'. No use of 'any' type - all components and data structures are properly typed with TypeScript strict mode enabled. Responsive design tested for mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints. The color palette uses custom earth (green) and ocean (blue) colors fitting the environmental theme."
